                <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                    Ipsum has been
                    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
                    type and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                    release of
                    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                    like Aldus
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
